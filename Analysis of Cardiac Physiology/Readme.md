# Analysis of Cardiac Physiology

Report explore the intricacies of the heart's behavior using simulation software(CircAdapt) which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.circadapt.org/). Report analyze about normal sinus rhythm, blood flow velocities, pressure-volume relations, and more. Investigate the opening and closing of valves, diastolic filling phases, and flow patterns. Utilize simulation data to understand the physiological processes during the cardiac cycle.
