# Properties of Hodgkin-Huxley Equations

Dive into the Hodgkin-Huxley equations to study the properties of action potentials in nerve cells. Analyze threshold behavior, refractoriness, repetitive activity, and temperature dependence of these equations. Use MATLAB to simulate and visualize the behavior of action potentials under different conditions.
