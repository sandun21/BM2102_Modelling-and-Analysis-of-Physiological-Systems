# Branched Cylinders: Dendritic Tree Approximations

This Repository contains reports related to investigation about the electrical properties of single-branched cables, focusing on dendritic tree approximations. For exploring the behavior of axonal and dendritic trees using MATLAB simulations to understand the principles of these branched systems and their implications for physiological signaling.
