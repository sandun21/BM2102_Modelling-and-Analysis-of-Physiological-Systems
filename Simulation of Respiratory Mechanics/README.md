# Simulation of Respiratory Mechanics

This report presents the simulation of respiratory mechanics under three different conditions: a normal adult, an adult with a restrictive pulmonary disease, and an adult with an obstructive pulmonary disease using the [simulator](https://in.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/75335-simulation-of-respiratory-mechanics-on-simulink-with-gui?requestedDomain=) developed by Leonardo Ro-driguez and Acevedo Guerrero (2020). This simulink model allows for the visualization of the respiratory mechanics under different conditions. 

Thc aim of this report is to analyze and discuss the differences in minute ventilation for the same setting of the ventilator under thc three different conditions. Thc findings of this report could provide valuable insights into thc cffccts of different pulmonary discases on respiratory mechanics.
